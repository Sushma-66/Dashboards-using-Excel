I recently built an interactive Sales & Profit Dashboard using Excel.
 The goal was to analyze business performance and provide clear insights into:
 âœ… Revenue trends over time
 âœ… Top-performing regions & products
 âœ… Customer contribution to total sales
 âœ… Profitability analysis
ðŸ”§ Tools & Features Used:
1. Excel PivotTables & PivotCharts
2. Slicers for interactivity
3. Conditional formatting for quick KPIs
4. Data cleaning & structuring for analysis
ðŸ’¡ Key Takeaway: A well-designed dashboard transforms raw data into a story that decision-makers can act on. This project reinforced my skills in data cleaning, analysis, and visualizationâ€”core aspects of a Business Analyst role.
